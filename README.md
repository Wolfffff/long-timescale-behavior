# Long Timescale Drosophila Behavior

## Goals
* Image individuals -- and later groups -- of Drosophila over the course of multiple days and capture fine-grained postural data.
* Identify long timescale behavioral variation and how it meshes with the current understanding of behavioral dynamics

## Current Setup

Currently, we are using a machine with a 2080 and P2000(rdp to 128.112.21.156 with ayroles-lab:Variation!) imaging through [labcams](https://bitbucket.org/jpcouto/labcams/src). The exact camera we are using is the [FLIR BFS-U3-32S4M-C](https://www.flir.com/products/blackfly-s-usb3/?model=BFS-U3-32S4M-C) paired with an Edmund Optics lens(Model #). We are currently underlighting with a Huion lightpad but will be switching to IR backlights.

## To Do
* Minimize ability to walk on wall and ceiling to improve tracking
    * Further test sigmacote
    * Try out insect-a-slip
