# Long Timescale Drosophila Behavior

## Goals
* Image individuals -- and later groups -- of Drosophila over the course of multiple days and capture fine-grained postural data.
* Identify long timescale behavioral variation and how it meshes with the current understanding of behavioral dynamics

## Current Setup

Currently, we are using a machine with a 2080 and P2000(rdp to 128.112.21.156 with ayroles-lab:Variation!) imaging through [labcams](https://bitbucket.org/jpcouto/labcams/src). The exact camera we are using is the [FLIR BFS-U3-32S4M-C](https://www.flir.com/products/blackfly-s-usb3/?model=BFS-U3-32S4M-C) paired with an Edmund Optics lens(Model #). We are currently underlighting with Advanced Illumination LED backlights(880nm). We are using a longpass filter [ThorLabs FEL0800](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=FEL0800) to avoid light contamination. We are cycling visible light(LED strips) using a outlet timer to create a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle with lights on at 8am.
