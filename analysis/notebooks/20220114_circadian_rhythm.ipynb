This is meant to be the most basic circadian rhythm analysis possible consisting of simple binned velocity statistics by hour of the day. It is likely that we should think more about what metrics to use but as a first pass, distance travelled and time spent moving seem appropriate. As with the previous notebook, most important functions are placed in `utils/trx_utils.py`. Again, we focus on two sets of data here: `exp1_cam1` which is the first camera from our long timescale data and '24h_bright' which is a dataset I gathered last weekend with significantly increased brightness and a verified light-dark cycle. Flies from `24h_bright` are not age matched. We should note that we are, for the most part, using 24h of `exp1_cam1` and 24h of `24h_bright` data rather than the full set of tracks. Further, `24h_bright` was processed using a newer model. For associated videos, see the videos `analysis/notebooks/` and the (massive) raw videos are on google drive([long-timescale-static](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1BFXIEEp_KnmDSPjONEU5h-CuK0-qy4ud)).\n","\n","\n","## Broad concerns\n","\n","One thing to note as you look through this notebook is the very different scales for the two datasets. `exp1_cam1` shows an *extremely* small amount of total movement compared to `24h_bright`. THis could be driven by a few difference sources: the lack of age matching for `24h_bright`, the extremely strong lighting conditions, or differences in plating(specifically the amount of food placed in each well). The flies in `24h_bright` also die slightly earlier -- approximately 5 days in rather than ~10."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import logging\n","from seaborn.distributions import distplot\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib as mpl\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","import pandas as pd\n","import h5py\n","import numpy as np\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import os\n","from datetime import datetime\n","import importlib\n","import time\n","wd = \"/Genomics/ayroleslab2/scott/long-timescale-behavior/analysis/\"\n","os.chdir(wd)\n","\n","import utils.trx_utils as trx_utils\n","\n","data_dir = \"/Genomics/ayroleslab2/scott/long-timescale-behavior/data/\"\n","track_dir = \"/Genomics/ayroleslab2/scott/long-timescale-behavior/data/tracks/\"\n","plots_dir = \"/Genomics/ayroleslab2/scott/long-timescale-behavior/analysis/plots/\"\n","logs_dir = \"/Genomics/ayroleslab2/scott/long-timescale-behavior/analysis/logs/\"\n","logging.basicConfig(\n","    filename=f'{logs_dir}{time.strftime(\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")}_circadian_rhythm.log',\n","    format=\"%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s\",\n","    level=logging.INFO,\n","    datefmt=\"%H:%M:%S\",\n",")\n","logger = logging.getLogger(\"analysis_logger\")\n","\n","# Plotting parameters\n","plots_prefix = \"\"\n","plt.rcParams[\"patch.linewidth\"] = 0\n","plt.rcParams[\"patch.edgecolor\"] = \"none\"\n","plt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (9, 3)\n","plt.rcParams[\"figure.dpi\"] = 300"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Metadata\n","Build up a dict containing all of our experimental metadata so that we don't need to manually enter it all through the notebook."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Stick to the first 24h for now.\n","exp1_cam1_h5s = [\n","    \"exp2_cam1_0through23.tracked.analysis.h5\",\n","    # \"exp2_cam1_24through47.tracked.analysis.h5\",\n","    # \"exp2_cam1_48through71.tracked.analysis.h5\",\n","    # \"exp2_cam1_72through95.tracked.analysis.h5\",\n","    # \"exp2_cam1_96through119.tracked.analysis.h5\",\n","]\n","exp1_cam1_h5s = [track_dir + filename for filename in exp1_cam1_h5s]\n","\n","bright_h5s = [\"24h_bright_0through23_0through29.tracked.analysis.h5\"]\n","bright_dir = \"/Genomics/ayroleslab2/scott/long-timescale-behavior/tmp/24h_bright/\"\n","bright_h5s = [bright_dir + filename for filename in bright_h5s]\n","\n","FMT = \"%w-%H:%M:%S\"\n","\n","# Build with dict for compatibility with JSON\n","expmt_dict = {\n","    \"exp1_cam1\": {\n","        \"h5s\": exp1_cam1_h5s,\n","        \"video\": \"exp1_cam1.mkv\",\n","        \"frame_rate\": 100,\n","        \"start_time\": datetime.strptime(\"0-22:33:00\", FMT),\n","        \"camera\": \"1\",\n","        \"experiment\": \"1\",\n","        \"video_path\": \"/Genomics/ayroleslab2/scott/long-timescale-behavior/data/exp1/exp5_202109014_2233/Camera1/exp.mkv\",\n","        \"px_mm\": 28.25,\n","    },\n","    \"24h_bright\": {\n","        \"h5s\": bright_h5s,\n","        \"video\": \"/Genomics/ayroleslab2/scott/long-timescale-behavior/tmp/24h_bright/24h_bright.mkv\",\n","        \"frame_rate\": 99.96,\n","        \"start_time\": datetime.strptime(\"0-12:00:00\", FMT),\n","        \"camera\": \"1\",\n","        \"experiment\": \"24h_bright\",\n","        \"video_path\": \"/Genomics/ayroleslab2/scott/long-timescale-behavior/tmp/24h_bright/24h_bright.mkv\",\n","        \"px_mm\": 28.25,\n","    },\n","}\n","px_mm = expmt_dict[\"exp1_cam1\"][\"px_mm\"]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" # Load h5 traces and match by quadrant\n"," For reference, fly node locations are in the form (time, node, coord, fly_idx).
